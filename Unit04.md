**Unit 4: Transcendental Functions** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will investigate the derivatives of trigonometric,
inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Along the
way, you will develop a technique of differentiation called implicit
differentiation. Aside from allowing you to compute derivatives of
inverse function, implicit differentiation will also be important in
studying related rates problems later on.*

**4.10 Limits Revisited** <span id="4.10"></span> 
-   **Reading: Whitman College: Professor David Guichard’s Calculus:
    “Chapter 4: Transcendental Functions:” “Section 4.10: Limits
    Revisited”**

    Revisited”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/calculus_04_Transcendental_Functions.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the PDF
    file, and read Section 4.10 in its entirety (pages 94-97). You will
    learn how derivatives relate back to limits. Limits of Indeterminate
    Forms (or limits of functions that, when evaluated, tend to 0/0 or
    ∞/∞) have previously been beyond our grasp. Using L’Hopital’s Rule,
    you will find that these limits are attainable with derivatives.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 1 hour to
    complete.

**4.11 Hyperbolic Functions** <span id="4.11"></span> 
-   **Reading: Whitman College: Professor David Guichard’s Calculus:
    “Chapter 4: Transcendental Functions:” “Section 4.11: Hyperbolic
    Functions”**
    Link: Whitman College: Professor David Guichard’s *Calculus:*

    Functions”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/calculus_04_Transcendental_Functions.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the PDF
    file, and read Section 4.11 in its entirety (pages 99–102). In this
    reading, you are introduced to the hyperbolic trigonometric
    functions. These functions, which appear in many engineering and
    physics applications, are specific combinations of exponential
    functions which have properties similar to those that the ordinary
    trigonometric functions have.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 1 hour to
    complete.
