title: "MA101-EXC: Single-Variable Calculus I"
course_description: "MA101-EXC is aligned with a challenge exam proctored by Excelsior College, a private, nonprofit institution with a credit-by-exam program that enables students to earn college level credit in select subject areas by passing proficiency examinations. This course differs from MA101, in that it also covers applications of integration, material that is addressed in Unit 2 of Saylor.org’s MA102: Single Variable Calculus II."

Course Syllabus for "MA101-EXC: Single-Variable Calculus I"
-----------------------------------------------------------

This course is designed to introduce you to the study of calculus. You
will learn concrete applications of how calculus is used and, more
importantly, why it works. Calculus is not a new discipline; it has been
around since the days of Archimedes. However, Isaac Newton and Gottfried
Leibniz, two seventeenth-century European mathematicians concurrently
working on the same intellectual discovery hundreds of miles apart, were
responsible for developing the field as we know it today. This brings us
to our first question, what is today’s calculus? In its simplest terms,
calculus is the study of functions, rates of change, and continuity.
While you may have cultivated a basic understanding of functions in
previous math courses, in this course you will come to a more advanced
understanding of their complexity, learning to take a closer look at
their behaviors and nuances. In this course, we will address three major
topics: limits, derivatives, and integrals, as well as study their
respective foundations and applications. By the end of this course, you
will have a solid understanding of the behavior of functions and graphs.
Whether you are entirely new to calculus or just looking for a refresher
on a particular topic, this course has something to offer, balancing
computational proficiency with conceptual depth. This course is designed
to align with Excelsior College’s UExcel Calculus examination. Visit the
[Excelsior website](http://www.excelsior.edu/exams/calculus), to
download the content guide for the MATX-150 exam.  For more information

### Course Information

Welcome to MA100-EXC. Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.   
  
 **Course** **Designer:** Clare Wickman  
  
 **Primary** **Resources:** This course comprises a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   Whitman College: Professor David Guichard’s
    [Calculus](http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus/)
-   MIT: Professor Jerison’s [Single Variable
    Calculus](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/)
-   Temple University: Gerardo Mendoza and Dan Reich’s [Calculus on the
    Web](http://www.math.temple.edu/~cow/): *Calculus Book I and
    Calculus Book II*

**Requirements** **for** **Completion:** In order to complete this
course, you will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned
materials. Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units; note that Unit 1 will mostly be a review.
You will also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Activities
-   Unit 2 Activities
-   Unit 3 Activities
-   Unit 4 Activities
-   Unit 5 Activities
-   Unit 6 Activities
-   Unit 7 Activities
-   Unit 8 Activities
-   Final Exam

To earn credit from Excelsior College for this course, you will need to
take the UExcel Calculus examination. Visit the [UExcel
website](http://www.uexceltest.com/exams-and-preparation/exams/), and
click on “MAT150 Calculus” for details about the UExcel Calculus
examination. In order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need
to work through all of the resources in this course, the activities
listed above, and Saylor’s final exam. For more information about
earning credit through The Saylor Foundation's partnership with
Excelsior College, please go
[here](http://www.saylor.org/student-credit-pathways/excelsior-college/).  
    
 Saylor has provided you with a final exam, which you may use as
practice for the UExcel Calculus exam. In order to pass, you will need
to earn a 70% or higher on the final exam. Your score on the exam will
be tabulated as soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the exam,
you may take it again.  
  
 **Time** **Commitment:** This course should take you approximately
**100** **hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
These estimates factor in the time required to watch each lecture, work
through each reading thoughtfully, and complete each activity. However,
these should be seen as guidelines, not goals; each learner is
different, and you may find that your pace changes throughout the
course. Mastery of the material, rather than strict adherence to the
time estimates, is the measure of success in this course. It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set a schedule for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 9.5
hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 4.5 hours) on Monday night;
subunit 1.3 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.
