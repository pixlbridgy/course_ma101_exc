title: "MA101-EXC: Single-Variable Calculus I"
course_description: "MA101-EXC is aligned with a challenge exam proctored by Excelsior College, a private, nonprofit institution with a credit-by-exam program that enables students to earn college level credit in select subject areas by passing proficiency examinations. This course differs from MA101, in that it also covers applications of integration, material that is addressed in Unit 2 of Saylor.org’s MA102: Single Variable Calculus II."

**Unit 3: Rules for Finding Derivates** <span id="3"></span> 
*Computing a derivative requires the computation of a limit. Because
limit computations can be rather involved, we like to minimize the
amount of work we have to do in practice. In this unit, we build up some
rules for differentiation which will speed up our calculations of
derivatives. In particular, you will see how to differentiate the sum,
difference, product, quotient, and composition of two (or more)
functions. You will also learn rules for differentiating power functions
(including polynomial and root functions).*

**3.3 The Product Rule** <span id="3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Whitman College: Professor David Guichard’s Calculus:
    “Chapter 3: Rules for Finding Derivatives:” “Section 3.3: The
    Product Rule”**

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Section 3.3
    in its entirety (pages 60 and 61). The naïve assumption is that the
    derivative of a product of two functions is the product of the
    derivatives of the two functions. This assumption is false. In this
    reading, you will see that the derivative of a product is slightly
    more complicated, but that it follows a definite rule, called the
    product rule.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 30 minutes to
    complete.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Section 3.4
    in its entirety (pages 62-65). As with products, the derivative of a
    quotient of two functions is not simply the quotient of the two
    derivatives. In this reading, you will see the quotient rule for
    differentiating a quotient of two functions. In particular, this
    will allow you to find the derivative of any rational function.
