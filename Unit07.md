**Unit 7: Integration** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit of the course, you will learn about* integral calculus, *a
subfield of calculus that studies the area formed under the curve of a
function. Though not necessarily intuitive, this concept is closely
related to the derivative, which you will revisit in this unit.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the PDF
    file, and read Section 7.1 in its entirety (pages 145-149). This
    reading motivates the integral through two examples. The first
    addresses the question of how to determine the distance traveled
    based only on information about velocity. The second addresses the
    question of how to determine the area under the graph of a function.
     Surprisingly, these two questions are closely related to each other
    and to the derivative.  
        
     Studying this reading should take approximately 1 hour to
    complete.

**7.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** <span id="7.2"></span> 
*Note: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is the apex of our course. It
explains the relationship between the derivative and the integral, tying
the two major facets of this course together. In the previous section,
you learned the definition of the definite integral as a limit of a
Riemann Sum. The computations were long and involved. In this subunit,
you will learn about the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which makes
computation of definite integrals significantly easier.*

    variables,” or rewriting a complicated integral in terms of
    elementary functions that we already know how to integrate. Simply
    speaking, integration by substitution is merely the act of taking
    the chain rule in reverse.

trigonometric functions previously.*

    Exponential Function.” Choose the format that is most appropriate
    for your Internet connection, and listen to the entire 21-minute
    video lecture.  
      
     The first short video gives one definition of the natural logarithm
    and derives all the properties of the natural log from that
    definition. It shows examples of limits, curve sketching,
    differentiation, and integration using the natural log. We will
    return to this video later to watch the last three slides. The
    second video explains the number e, the exponential function and its
    derivative and antiderivative, curve sketching using the exponential
    function, and how to perform similar operations on power functions
    with other bases using the change of base formula.
