     **Note**: This exam has been designed as a *practice exam* for the
    credit bearing Excelsior College/UExcel **MATX-150 Calculus** exam.
    You can register for that exam
    [here](http://my.excelsior.edu/secapps/partner/1/go/examreg). Please
    note that unlike The Saylor Foundation practice exam for this
    course, which is free, the Excelsior College exam will cost
    **$95.00.** Passing that exam will earn students **4 hours** of
    college credit, which can be applied to an Excelsior College degree
    program, or potentially transfered to another college.
