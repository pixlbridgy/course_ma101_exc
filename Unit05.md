title: "MA101-EXC: Single-Variable Calculus I"
course_description: "MA101-EXC is aligned with a challenge exam proctored by Excelsior College, a private, nonprofit institution with a credit-by-exam program that enables students to earn college level credit in select subject areas by passing proficiency examinations. This course differs from MA101, in that it also covers applications of integration, material that is addressed in Unit 2 of Saylor.org’s MA102: Single Variable Calculus II."

**Unit 5: Curve Sketching** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will ask you to apply a little critical thinking to the
topics this course has covered thus far. To properly sketch a curve, you
must analyze the function and its first and second derivatives in order
to obtain information about how the function behaves, taking into
account its intercepts, asymptotes (vertical and horizontal), maximum
values, minimum values, points of inflection, and the respective
intervals between each of the above. After collecting this information,
you will need to piece it all together in order to sketch an
approximation to the graph of the original function.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 10.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 3 hours
☐    Subunit 5.2: 1.75 hours

☐    Subunit 5.3: 1.5 hours

☐    Subunit 5.4: 1.5 hours

☐    Subunit 5.5: 2.5 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   define local and absolute extrema;
-   use critical points to find local extrema;
-   use the first and second derivative tests to find intervals of
    increase and decrease and to find information about concavity and
    inflection points; and
-   sketch graphs of functions by using information from the first and
    second derivative tests.
