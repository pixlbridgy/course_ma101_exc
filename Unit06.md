title: "MA101-EXC: Single-Variable Calculus I"
course_description: "MA101-EXC is aligned with a challenge exam proctored by Excelsior College, a private, nonprofit institution with a credit-by-exam program that enables students to earn college level credit in select subject areas by passing proficiency examinations. This course differs from MA101, in that it also covers applications of integration, material that is addressed in Unit 2 of Saylor.org’s MA102: Single Variable Calculus II."

**Unit 6: Applications of the Derivative** <span id="6"></span> 
*With a sufficient amount of sophisticated machinery under your belt,
you will now start to look at how differentiation can be used to solve
problems in various applied settings. Optimization is an important
notion in fields like biology, economics, and physics when we want to
know when growth is maximized, for example.*  
    
 *In addition to providing methods to solve problems directly, the
derivative can also be used to find approximate solutions to problems.
You will explore two such methods in this section: Newton’s method and
the method of differentials.*

**6.2 Related Rates** <span id="6.2"></span> 
*Note: You now know how to take the derivative with respect to the
independent variable.  In other words, you know how to determine a
function’s rate of change when given the input’s rate of change. But
what if the independent variable was itself a function? What if, for
example, the input was a function of time? How do we identify how the
function changes as time changes? This subunit will explore the answers
to these questions.*

**6.3 Newton’s Method** <span id="6.3"></span> 
*Note: Newton’s Method is a process by which we estimate the roots of a
real-valued function. You may remember the bisection method, where we
find a root by creating smaller and smaller intervals. Newton's Method
uses the derivative in order to account for both the speed at which the
function changes and its actual position. This creates an algorithm that
can help us identify the location of roots even more quickly.*  
    
 *Newton's Method requires that you start “sufficiently close” (a
somewhat arbitrary specification that varies from problem to problem) to
the actual root in order to estimate it with accuracy. If you start too
far from the root, then the algorithm can be led awry in certain
situations.*
