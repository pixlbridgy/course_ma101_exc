**Unit 2: Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative** <span
id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study the instantaneous rate of change of a
function. Motivated by this concept, you will develop the notion of
limits, continuity, and the derivative. The limit asks the question,
“What does the function do as the independent variable becomes closer
and closer to a certain value?” In simpler terms, the* limit *is the*
natural tendency*of a function. The limit is incredibly important due to
its relationship to the derivative, the integral, and countless other
key mathematical concepts. A strong understanding of the limit is
essential to success in the field of mathematics.*  
    
 *A derivative is a description of how a function changes as its input
varies.  In the case of a straight line, this derivative, or slope, is
the same at every point, which is why we can describe the slope of an
entire function with one number when it is linear. You will learn that
we can do the same for nonlinear functions. The slope, however, will not
be constant; it will change as the independent variable changes.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Section 2.4
    in its entirety (pages 46–50). In this reading, you will see how
    limits are used to compute derivatives. A derivative is a
    description of how a function changes as its input varies. In the
    case of a straight line, this description is the same at every
    point, which is why we can describe the slope (another word for the
    derivative) of an entire function with one slope when it is linear.
    You will learn that we can do the same for nonlinear functions. The
    slope, however, will not be constant; it will change as the
    independent variable changes.
