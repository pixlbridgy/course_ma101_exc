**Unit 1: Analytic Geometry** <span id="1"></span> 
*Most of the material in this unit will be review. However, the notions
of points, lines, circles, distance, and functions will be central in
everything that follows. Lines are basic geometric objects which will be
of great importance in the study of differential calculus, particularly
in the study of tangent lines and linear approximations.*  
    
 *We will also take a look at the practical uses of mathematical
functions. This course will use mathematical models, or structures, that
predict practical situations in order to describe and study a number of
real-life problems and situations. They are essential to the development
of every major business and every scientific field in the modern world.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐   Subunit 1.1: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐   Subunit 1.2: 2 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon the successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   create and analyze graphs of points, lines, and circles in the
    plane;
-   define and identify the domain, range, and graph of a function;
-   define and identify one-to-one, onto, and linear functions; and
-   analyze and graph transformations of functions, such as shifts and
    dilations.
